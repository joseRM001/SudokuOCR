# SudokuOCR
Sudoku solver using OCR.
This project is an algorithms practice (essentially backtracking to solve a sudoku), it is capable to solve any NxN sudoku (with N>=9, regions of 3x3). 

The goal of this project is to use OCR to be able to load any sudoku from an image into the program (using Tesseract API).

The project may not be perfect, as I am still studying C++.
